Q31. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM? 
 ● JDK (Java Development Kit) – Contains JRE + development tools
 (compiler, debugger) for developing and running Java applications.
 ● JRE (Java Runtime Environment) – Includes JVM + libraries needed
 to run Java applications but lacks development tools.
 ● JVM (Java Virtual Machine) – Executes Java bytecode, providing
 platform independence and memory management (GC).
 JDK > JRE > JVM – JDK includes JRE, and JRE includes JVM. 
JDK is for developers, while JRE is for users running Java applications
